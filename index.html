            <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Madhurima Mishra. I am a Software Engineer at MegaTech , living in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
              I graduated from ITER Bhubaneswar, Odisha. 
              I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional
              path has taken many twists and turns — as i had been in a job for last 3year as a programmer  and manual tester at 
              megatech — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

              As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for learning things.
               That's why I’m excited to work at
              a high growth company.
              In my free time I watch series and movies, you can checkout my movie profile on LetterBoxd:.
              I read some fiction like(harry porter) non-fiction like (Becoming Michelle Obama), but haven’t got much head into that field.

      <h3>Miller Projects</h3>

      <p>FSCW Department Software,
        This software system will be a web based system for the FSCW Department and will have two modules,
        i.e.FPS Module and Miller Module. This system will be designed to keep detailed record of the inspector's
        inspection in their respective allotted demography.
        One of the key benefits of the system is that it makes it possible to compare the values of Physical Balance and
        Book Balance of the items being inspected. This system will increase the efficiency of the inspector and will
        assist higher authorities in the Department in getting detailed view of the data in different formats as
        desired, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. With the availability of detailed data without
        much difficulty, it will be helpful in decision making for higher authorities of the department.

        Inspectors will upload Physical Inspection data of their respective allotted Fair Price Shops(FPS) and
        Government Mills for Rice & Wheat processing plants. System will generate different reports with the data
        submitted by the inspector. Each inspector will be provided with separate user ID and password to enter data. A
        super-user can view data of entire state of Odisha.<br>

        · There are two basic users – Super user, User.<br>

        · All users have their own profiles in Inspector Module. </p>
